## Video

As per the instructions, there is no link to the deployed application as with the other projects. An instructional/demonstration video has been made to show how to use the application and what it can do. Click the screenshot to go to the youtube link, or click here: https://youtu.be/vXDXccwKsU8

## Sample README

A sample README was created in the above video. This README is then placed in the "GENERATED-README" folder. The sample README generated by that video demonstration is currently in the folder now. You can view it by going to this link: https://github.com/tcunningham203/readme-generator/blob/main/GENERATED-README/README.md


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open a terminal window in the root folder.
3. Type "node index.js" into your console.
4. The program will ask you a series of questions to fill out your README. These questions include the app title, app description, app instructions, app features and usage, guidelines for contributions, instructions for any tests, license prefrences, github username, and email.
5. For each of these prompts, type what you want to appear on the README, then press enter. The next question will appear. One exception is the license question. For that one, you are given a dropdown of 5 options. The first 4 are for a license, and the 5th is for no license. For this question, select with the up and down arrow keys before pressing enter.
6. Once all the information has been entered, the README will generate. It will appear in the GENERATED-README folder (so as not to delete what you're reading right now!)
7. You can then take that README file and copy it to your own project.


## Development
In this section, I'll briefly discuss some of the challenges and successes with the project, as well as goals for the future.


## Credits

Because the previous project (my readme generator) also used Inquirer.js, I used my code from that project as a starting point. As the project went on, that code was replaced with code better suited for this project. 

I copied the suggested file structure from the project instructions.

I used various learning resources like Stack Overflow and W3 schools to help with random questions I had. 

I used the Inquirer.js documentation and Jest documentation a lot for this project as well to help create my code. 

In order to limit the letters on the SVG to 3 characters or less, I used this package and its documentation: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer-maxlength-input-prompt
