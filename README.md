## Video

As per the instructions, there is no link to the deployed application as with the other projects. An instructional/demonstration video has been made to show how to use the application and what it can do. Click the screenshot to go to the youtube link, or click here: https://youtu.be/weBMA3ymA9A

## Sample SVG

A sample SVG logo was created in the above video. This SVG is then placed in the "samples" folder. The sample SVG generated by that video demonstration is currently in the folder now. You can view it by going to this link: https://github.com/tcunningham203/SVG-logo-maker/blob/main/examples/logo.svg


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open a terminal window in the root folder.
3. Type "node index.js" into your console.
4. The program will ask you a series of questions to create your SVG. These questions include the text, the text color, the background shape, and the background shape color.
5. For the color prompts, you can type a color, or use one of the 6 character hex codes. For the text, you can type up to 3 letters. The letters are case sensitive, meaning if you type uppercase it will appear uppercase, and visa versa. If you try to type more than 3, the program will not proceed to the next step. For the shape prompt, you can choose between circle, square, or triangle.
6. Once all the information has been entered, the SVG logo will generate. It will appear in the samples folder.
7. If you want to generate a new SVG logo, remember to rename the first one or move it to a different folder.

## Tests
This application features a test. Type "npm run test" to run the test. All tests should work.

The 3 shapes featured in the test are available in the samples folder if you want to get an idea of what they are meant to look like.

## Development
In this section, I'll briefly discuss some of the challenges and successes with the project, as well as goals for the future.

Overall, this project was one of the easier ones I've done. This is because the previous project, the README generator, was so similar, so I was able to use that code as starter code and alter a few things. Also, I have a lot of familiarity with SVGs because I've used them before for my Pokedex project. So it was very easy to get a grasp on the fundamentals for this project.

In the future, I would like to flesh out the options more. The requirements called for 3 shape options, but I would like to expand this to more shapes, and add additional effect options as well. I would also like to expand options for text, perhaps having multiple rows of text, or at least more than 3 characters (again, restricted by the project requirements.)

## Credits

Because the previous project (my readme generator) also used Inquirer.js, I used my code from that project as a starting point. As the project went on, that code was replaced with code better suited for this project. 

I copied the suggested file structure from the project instructions.

I used various learning resources like Stack Overflow and W3 schools to help with random questions I had. 

I used the Inquirer.js documentation and Jest documentation a lot for this project as well to help create my code. 

I used the SVG extension to help create the shapes in the shapes.js file. 

In order to limit the letters on the SVG to 3 characters or less, I used this package and its documentation: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer-maxlength-input-prompt
